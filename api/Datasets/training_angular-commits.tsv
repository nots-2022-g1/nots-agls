3	compiler specify angularcore a peer dependency the compiler generates code for the angular runtime in angularcore which ha to be the exact same version a otherwise there may be version skew between what the compiler generates and what the runtime support this would result in hard to diagnose problem at runtime by adding a peer dependency for angularcompiler on angularcore we can let the package manager report an error npm or warning npm yarn during installation to signal that the set of package is incompatible pr close 	refactor

9	router remove special logic for hybrid apps this commit remove special undocumented logic in the router code that is meant to prevent duplicate navigation that result from location syncs in angularjsangular hybrid application the duplicate navigation can occur when both the router and the angularjs sync code detect a location change via a popstatehashchange event when this happens the angular router schedule a navigation to sync itself with the browser but the hybrid listener may also schedule an additional navigation there are a few reason this logic should not be included in the router this special logic is not tree shakeable so it introduces a bundle size cost for all application most of which dont need it there have been many update to the routing pipeline to tolerate duplicate navigation that is duplicate navigation can happen and routing should still complete successfully the logic is really in the wrong place the hybrid sync code should be the location to handle this if duplicate navigation are meant to be avoided the hybrid sync code should have handling to not trigger duplicate navs this logic also used to exist because the mock location helper used for test incorrectly triggered popstate event during router navigation in order to avoid unexpected behavior in test this logic needed to be added this incorrect mocking may also have been put in place because the upgrade module would see a location change event and trigger a duplicate navigation the location mock ha since been updated to match real browser behavior so this is no longer necessary the upgrade module ha also been updated to not trigger duplicate navigation the following commits are related to this side note the settimeout in the location change listener is used to ensure the ordering of duplicate navigation wa consistent you can see that the logic being removed here expects the imperative navigation to precede the popstatehashchange with the removal of this code the settimeout no longer serf a purpose however it ha been found that test can rely on this behavior incorrectly because they expect the navigation to be complete but in reality it hasnt even started because the test ha not flushed the timeout removing the timeout would be a breaking change a a result pr close 	refactor

16	router take only the first emitted value of every resolver to make it consistent with guard the router used to wait for the resolvers to complete and take the last value the change here take only the first emitted value of every resolver and proceed the navigation this match how other guard work in the router code resolve breaking change previously resolvers were waiting to be completed before proceeding with the navigation and the router would take the last value emitted from the resolver the router now take only the first emitted value by the resolvers and then proceeds with navigation this is now consistent with observables returned by other guard only the first value is used pr close 	refactor
17	form move getrawvalue into the abstractcontrol hierarchy currently there is a freestanding getrawvalue function which examines the type of the control this is an issue for refactoring modelts because it creates unnecessary dependency between the abstractcontrol class it is cleaner to simply add this method to the model hierarchy and call it directly and will ease upcoming refactoring pr close 	refactor

47	core avoid storing lview in ngcontext these change combine and currently we save a reference to an lview on most dom node created by angular either by saving the lview directly in the ngcontext or by saving the lcontext which ha a reference to the lview this can be a problem if the dom node is retained in memory because the lview ha reference to all of the child node of the view a well a other internal data structure previously we tried to resolve the issue by clearing the ngcontext when a node is removed see but we decided not to proceeed because it can slow down destruction due to a megamorphic write these change aim to address the issue while reducing the performance impact by assigning a unique id when an lview is created and adding it to ngcontext all active view are tracked in a map where their unique id is used a the key we dont need to worry about leak within that map because lviews are an internal data structure and we have complete control over when they are created and destroyed fix pr close 	perf

72	form incorrectly keeping track of ngmodel with ngfor inside a form when an ngmodel is created within a form it receives an ngcontrol based on it name but the control doesnt get swapped out if the name change this can lead to problem if the ngmodel is part of an ngfor because the name can change based on it position in the list and a new control can be defined with the same name leading u to having multiple directive pointing to the same control for example if we start off with a list like ngmodel ngmodel ngmodel then we remove the second item ngmodel ngmodel and finally if we decide to add an item to the end of the list well already have a control for index causing the list to look like ngmodel ngmodel ngmodel these change fix the issue by removing the old control when the name of the directive change fix fix pr close 	fix

75	compiler allow bananainabox binding to end with nonnull assertion for twowaybindings that use the bananainabox syntax the compiler synthesizes an event assignment expression from the primary expression it is valid for the primary expression to be terminated by the nonnull operator however naive string substitution is used for the synthesized expression such that the would immediately precede the token resulting in the valid operator token the expression would still parse correctly but it doesnt implement the proper semantics resulting in incorrect runtime behavior changing the expression substitution to force a space between the primary expression and the assignment avoids this mistake but it uncovers a new issue the grammar doe not allow for the lh of an assignment to be the nonnull operator so the synthesized expression would fail to parse to alleviate this the synthesized expression is parsed with a special parser flag to allow for this syntax fix pr close 	fix

614	router prevent url flicker when new navigation cancel ongoing one this bit of code is problematic for several reason angularjsspecific handling should not exist in core router code if it can be avoided it not something that should complicated the code longterm it cause url flickering the replace really doe happen and can be observed the original intent wa likely for the url to not actually change since the router only initially supported deferred navigation this would usually be the case it actually cause observer of url change more problem in handling change because the router is already about to process another navigation request notice that when using computed restoration logic we do not reset the url because it would cause another location change event and conflict with the new navigation it only reset the browser url but doe nothing to sync the rest of the internal state of the router it make guard which call routernavigate behave slightly differently than guard which return urltree guard which return urltree do not reset the url but instead just trigger a new navigation it reset the entire url rather than just the portion that the urlhandlingstrategy is configured to handle theoretically the router could be configured to only handle a part of the url so failed navigation should not reset part it is not configured to touch note that this is actually a problem in other place in the router a well where resetstate is not called before reseturltocurrenturltree a a nice benefit when urlupdatestrategy is set to eager this make possible breaking change the router will no longer replace the browser url when a new navigation cancel an ongoing navigation this often cause url flicker and wa only in place to support some angularjs hybrid application hybrid application which rely on the navigationid being present on initial navigation that were handled by the angular router should instead subscribe to navigationcancel event and perform the locationreplacestate themselves to add navigationid to the router state in addition test which assert urlchanges on the spylocation may need to be adjusted to account for the replacestate which is no longer triggered pr close 	fix

973	serviceworker correctly determine client id on navigation request the serviceworker assigns an appversion to a each client to ensure that all subsequent request for a client are served using the same appversion the assignment is done based on the client id previously the serviceworker would only try to read the client id off of the fetchevents clientid property however for navigation request the new client id will be set on resultingclientid while clientid will either be empty or hold the id of the client where the request initiated from see also related discussion in wcserviceworker and wcserviceworker in theory this could lead to the navigation request ie indexhtml being served from a different appversion than the subsequent subresource request ie asset in practice the likelihood of this happening is probably very low though since it would require the latest appversion to be updated between the initial navigation request and the first subresource request which should happen very shortly after the navigation request this commit ensures that the correct client id is determined even for navigation request by also taking the resultingclientid property into account pr close 	fix

983	compilercli use typescript transform to emit type parameter the template type checker is capable of recreating generic type bound in a different context rewriting type reference along the way if possible this wa previously done using a visitor that only supported a limited set of type resulting in the inability to emit all sort of type even if they dont contain type reference at all the inability to emit generic type bound wa not critical when the type parameter emitting logic wa introduced a the compiler also ha a fallback strategy of creating inline type constructor however this fallback is not available to the language service resulting in inaccurate type when componentsdirectives use a complex generic type to mitigate this problem the specialized visitor ha been replaced with a generalized typescript transform where only type reference get special treatment this allows for more complex type to be emitted such a union and intersection type object literal type and tuple type pr close 	refactor

1221	languageservice enable renaming of pipe this commit update the logic in the l renaming to handle renaming of pipe both from the name expression in the pipe metadata a well a from the template the approach here is to introduce a new concept for renaming an indirect rename in this type of rename we find rename location in with the native t language service using a different node than the one we are renaming using pipe a an example if we want to rename the pipe name from the string literal expression we use the transform method to find rename location rather than the string literal itself which will not return any result because it just a string so the general approach is determine the detail about the requested rename location ie the targeted template node and symbol for a template rename or the t node for a rename outside a template using the detail of the location determine if the node is attempting to rename something that is an indirect rename pipe selector binding other renames are considered direct and we use whatever result the native tsls return for the rename location in the case of indirect renames we throw out result that do not appear in the template in this case the shim file these result will be for the indirect rename that we dont want to touch but are only using to find template result create an additional rename result for the string literal expression that is used for the inputoutput alias the pipe name or the selector note that renaming is moving towards being much more accurate in it result than find reference when the approach for renaming stabilizes we may want to then port the change back to being shared with the approach for retrieving reference pr close 	feat

1453	compiler avoid parsing emptyexpr with a backwards span emptyexpr is somewhat unique in that it constructed in a circumstance where the parser ha been looking for a particular token or string of token and ha failed to find any this mean the parser state when constructing emptyexpr is fairly unique this give rise to a bug where the parser construct emptyexpr with a backwards span a start value thats beyond the end value this likely happens because of the strange state the parser is in when recovering with emptyexpr this commit add a backstopworkaround to avoid constructing such broken emptyexpr span or any other kind of span eventually the parser state should be fixed such that this doe not occur but that requires a significant change to the parser functionality so a simple fix in th interim is in order pr close 	fix

2261	compilercli remove the concept of an errored trait previously if a trait analysis step resulted in diagnostics the trait would be considered errored and no further operation including register would be performed effectively this meant that the compiler would pretend the class in question wa actually undecorated however this behavior is problematic for several reason it lead to inaccurate diagnostics being reported downstream for example if a component is put into the error state for example due to a template error the ngmodule which declares the component would produce a diagnostic claiming that the declaration is neither a directive nor a pipe this happened because the compiler wouldnt register the component trait so the component would not be recorded a actually being a directive it can cause incorrect behavior on incremental build this bug is more complex but the general issue is that if the compiler fails to associate a component and it module then incremental build will not correctly reanalyze the module when the component template change failing to register the component a such is one link in the larger chain of issue that result in these kind of issue it lump together diagnostics produced during analysis and resolve step this is not causing issue currently a the dependency graph ensures the right class are reanalyzed when needed instead of showing stale diagnostics however the dependency graph wa not intended to serve this role and could potentially be optimized in way that would break this functionality this commit remove the concept of an errored trait entirely from the trait system instead analyzed and resolved trait have corresponding and separate diagnostics in addition to potentially null analysis result analysis but not resolution diagnostics are carried forward during incremental build operation compilation emit is only performed when a trait reach the resolved state with no diagnostics this change is functionally different than before a the register step is now performed even in the presence of analysis error a long a analysis result are also produced this fix problem above and is part of the larger solution to problem pr close 	fix

3658	compiler switch to referencedfiles for shim generation shim generation wa built on a lie shim are file added to the program which arent original file authored by the user but file authored effectively by the compiler these fall into two category file which will be generated like the ngfactory shim we generate for view engine compatibility a well a file used internally in compilation like the ngtypecheckts file previously shim generation wa driven by the rootfiles passed to the compiler a input these are effectively the file listed in the tsconfigjson each shim generator eg the factorygenerator would examine the rootfiles and produce a list of shim file name which it would be responsible for generating these name would then be added to the rootfiles when the program wa created the fatal flaw here is that rootfiles doe not always account for all of the file in the program in fact it quite rare that it doe user dont typically specify every file directly in file instead they rely on typescript during program creation starting with a few root file and transitively discovering all of the file in the program this happens however during tscreateprogram which is too late to add new file to the rootfiles list a a result shim generation wa only including shim for file actually listed in the tsconfigjson file and not for the transitive set of file in the user program a it should this commit completely rewrite shim generation to use a different technique for adding file to the program inspired by view engine shim generator in this new technique a the program is being created and tssourcefiles are being requested from the ngcompilerhost shim for those file are generated and a reference to them is patched onto the original file tssourcefilereferencedfiles this cause t to think that the original file reference the shim and cause the shim to be included in the program the original referencedfiles array is saved and restored after program creation hiding this little hack from the rest of the system the new shim generation engine differentiates between two kind of shim toplevel shim such a the flat module entrypoint file and ngtypecheckts and perfile shim such a ngfactory or ngsummary file the former are included via rootfiles a before the latter are included via the referencedfiles of their corresponding original file a a result of this change shim are now correctly generated for all file in the program not just the one named in tsconfigjson a few mitigating factor prevented this bug from being realized until now in g file doe include the transitive closure of file in the program in cli apps shim are not really used this change also make use of a novel technique for associating information with source file the use of an ngextension symbol to patch the information directly onto the ast object this is used in several circumstance for shim metadata about a tssourcefiles status a a shim and it origin are held in the extension data for original file the original referencedfiles are stashed in the extension data for later restoration the main benefit of this technique is a lot le bookkeeping around map of tssourcefiles to various kind of data which need to be tracked invalidated a part of incremental build this technique is based on design used internally in the typescript compiler and is serving a a prototype of this design in ngtsc if it work well it could have benefit across the rest of the compiler pr close 	fix

5409	ngcc ensure private export are added for modulewithproviders ngcc may need to insert public export into the bundle source a well a to the entrypoints declaration file a the ivy compiler may need to create import statement to internal library type the way ngcc know which export to add is through the reference registry to which reference to thing that require a public export are added by the various analysis step that are executed one of these analysis step is the augmentation of declaration file where function that return modulewithproviders are updated so that a generic type argument is added that corresponds with the ngmodule that is actually imported this type ha to be publicly exported so the analyzer step ha to add the module type to the reference registry a problem occurs when modulewithproviders already ha a generic type argument in which case no update of the declaration file is necessary this may happen when ngcc is processing additional bundle format so that the declaration file ha already been updated while processing the first bundle format or when a package is processed which already contains the generic type in it source in both scenario it may occur that the referenced ngmodule type doe not yet have a public export so it is crucial that a reference to the type is added to the reference registry which ngcc failed to do this commit fix the issue by always adding the referenced ngmodule type to the reference registry so that a public export will always be created if necessary resolve fw pr close 	fix

5519	ngcc add support for asynchronous execution previously ngccs programmatic api would run and complete synchronously this wa necessary for specific usecases such a how the angularcli invokes ngcc a part of the typescript module resolution process but not for others eg running ivyngcc a a postinstall script this commit add a new option async that enables turning on asynchronous execution ie it signal that the caller is ok with the function call to complete asynchronously which allows ngcc to potentially run in a more efficient mode currently there is no difference in the way task are executed in sync v async mode but this change set the ground for adding new execution option that require asynchronous operation such a processing task in parallel on multiple process note when using the programmatic api the default value for async is false thus retaining backwards compatibility when running ngcc from the command line ie via the ivyngcc script it run in async mode to be able to take advantage of future optimization but that is transparent to the caller pr close 	refactor

5636	ivy convert all ngtsc diagnostics to tsdiagnostics historically the angular compiler ha produced both native typescript diagnostics called tsdiagnostics and it own internal diagnostic format called an apidiagnostic this wa done because typescript tsdiagnostics can not be produced for file not in the tsprogram and template type checking diagnostics are naturally produced for external html template file this design isnt optimal for several reason downstream tooling such a the cli must support multiple format of diagnostics adding to the maintenance burden tsdiagnostics have gotten a lot better in recent release with support for suggested change highlighting of the code in question etc none of these change have been of any benefit for apidiagnostics which have continued to be reported in a very primitive fashion a future plugin model will not support anything but tsdiagnostics so generating apidiagnostics is a blocker for ngtscasaplugin the split complicates both the typing and the testing of ngtsc to fix this issue this commit change template typechecking to produce tsdiagnostics instead instead of reporting a special kind of diagnostic for external template file error in a template are always reported in a tsdiagnostic that highlight the portion of the template which contains the error when this template text is distinct from the source t file for example when the template is parsed from an external resource file additional contextual information link the error back to the originating component a template error can thus be reported in separate way depending on how the template wa configured for inline template string which can be directly mapped to offset in the t code tsdiagnostics point to real range in the source this is the case if an inline template is used with a string literal or a nosubstitution string for example typescript component template pbar bazp export class testcmp bar string the above template contains an error no baz property of testcmp the error produced by t will look like pbar bazp testts error t property baz doe not exist on type testcmp did you mean bar for template string which can not be directly mapped to offset in the t code a logical offset into the template string will be included in the error message for example typescript const sometemplate pbar bazp component template sometemplate export class testcmp bar string because the template is a reference to another variable and is not an inline string constant the compiler will not be able to use absolute position when parsing the template a a result error will report logical offset into the template string pbar bazp testts testcmp template error t property baz doe not exist on type testcmp testts component template template error occurs in the template of component testcmp this error message us logical offset into the template string and also give a reference to the template expression from which the template wa parsed this help in locating the component which contains the error for external template templateurl the error message is delivered within the html template file testcmphtml instead and additional information contextualizes the error on the templateurl expression from which the template file wa determined pbar bazp testcmphtml error t property baz doe not exist on type testcmp testts component templateurl testcmphtml error occurs in the template of component testcmp pr close 	feat

5724	ivy ngcc avoid unnecessary operation when we only need one format processed previously when ngcc wa called with compileallformats false ie how angularcli call it it would not attempt to process more property once the first wa successfully processed however it would continue looping over them and perform some unnecessary operation such a determining the format each property map to which can be an expensive operation for some property mapping to either umd or commonjs checking whether each property ha been processed which involves checking whether any property ha been processed with a different version of ngcc each time potentially marking property a processed which involves a filewrite operation this commit avoids the unnecessary operation by entirely skipping subsequent property once the first one ha been successfully processed while this theoretically improves performance it is not expected to have any noticeable impact in practice since the list of propertiestoconsider is typically small and the most expensive operation marking a property a processed ha low likelihood of happening plus these operation are a tiny fraction of ngccs work pr close 	perf
5725	ivy ngcc avoid unnecessary filewrite operation when marking property a processed previously when ngcc needed to mark multiple property a processed eg a processed format property and typing or all supported property for a nonangular entrypoint it would update each one separately and write the file to disk multiple time this commit change this so that multiple property can be updated at once with one filewrite operation while this theoretically improves performance reducing the io operation it is not expected to have any noticeable impact in practice since these operation are a tiny fraction of ngccs work this change will be useful for a subsequent change to mark all property that map to the same formatpath a processed once it is processed the first time pr close 	perf

5869	ivy ngcc resolve main property path correctly there are two place in the ngcc processing where it need to load the content of a file given by a general path when determining the format of an entrypoint to do this ngcc us the value of the relevant property in packagejson but in the case of main it must parse the content of the entrypoint file to decide whether the format is umd or commonjs when parsing the source file for dependency to determine the order in which compilation must occur the relative import in each file are parsed and followed recursively looking for external import previously we naively assumed that the path would match the file name exactly but actually we must consider the standard module resolution convention eg the extension j may be missing or the path may refer to a directory containing an indexjs file this commit fix both place this commit now requires the dependencyhost instance to check the existence of more file than before at worst all the different possible postfix this should not create a significant performance reduction for ngcc since the result of the check will be cached and similar work is done inside the t compiler so what we lose in doing it here is saved later in the processing the main performance loss would be where there are lot of file that need to be parsed for dependency that do not end up being processed by t but compared to the main ngcc processing this dependency parsing is a small proportion of the work done and so should not impact much on the overall performance of ngcc fw pr close 	fix

6706	ivy dont track identifier of ffrresolved reference this fix is for a bug in the ngtsc partialevaluator which statically evaluates expression sometimes evaluating a reference requires resolving a function which is declared in another module and thus no function body is available to support this case the partialevaluator ha the concept of a foreign function resolver this allows the interpretation of expression like const router routermoduleforroot even though the definition of the forroot function ha no body in ngtsc today this will be resolved to a reference to routermodule itself via the modulewithproviders foreign function resolver however the partialevaluator also associate any identifier in the path of this resolution with the reference this is done so that if the user writes const x importedy x can be generated a a local identifier instead of adding an import for y this wa at the heart of a bug in the above case with router the partialevaluator added the identifier router to the reference generated through ffr to routermodule this is not correct reference that result from ffr expression may not have the same value at runtime a they do at compile time indeed this is not the case for modulewithproviders the reference generated via ffr is synthetic in the sense that it constructed based on a useful interpretation of the code not an accurate representation of the runtime value therefore it may not be legal to refer to the reference via the router identifier this commit add the ability to mark such a reference a synthetic which allows the partialevaluator to not add the router identifier down the line test are included for both the partialevaluator itself a well a the resultant buggy behavior in ngtsc overall pr close 	fix

6834	ivy use the imported name of decorator for detection currently ngtsc ha a bug where if you alias the name of a decorator when importing it it wont be detected properly this is because the compiler us the aliased name and not the original declared name of the decorator for detection this commit fix the compiler to compare against the declared name of decorator when available and add a test to prevent regression pr close 	fix
6835	ivy track cyclic import that are added ngtsc ha cyclic import detection to determine when adding an import to a directive or pipe would create a cycle however this detection must also account for already inserted import a it possible for both direction of a circular import to be inserted by ivy a opposed to at least one of those edge existing in the user program this commit fix the circular import detection for component to take into consideration already added edge this is difficult for one critical reason only edge to file which will actually be imported should be considered however that depends on which directive pipe are used in a given template which is currently only known by running the templatedefinitionbuilder during the compile phase this is too late the decision whether to use remote scoping which consults the import graph is made during the resolve phase before any compilation ha taken place thus the only way to correctly consider synthetic edge is for the compiler to know exactly which directive pipe are used in a template during resolve there are two way to achieve this refactor templatedefinitionbuilder to do it work in two phase with directive matching occurring a a separate step which can be performed earlier use the rtargetbinder in the resolve phase to independently bind the template and get information about used directive option is ideal but option is currently used for practical reason the cost of binding the template can be shared with templatetypechecking pr close 	fix
6836	ivy support dynamic host attribute binding in the component decorator the host field is an object which represents host binding the type of this field is complex but is generally of the form key string string several different kind of binding can be specified depending on the structure of the key for example component host prop someexpr will bind an expression someexpr to the property prop this is known to be a property binding because of the square bracket in the binding key if the binding key is a plain string no bracket or parenthesis then it is known a an attribute binding in this case the righthand side is not interpreted a an expression but is instead a constant string there is no actual requirement that at build time these constant string are known to the compiler but this wa previously enforced a a side effect of requiring the binding expression for property and event binding to be statically known a they need to be parsed this commit break that relationship and allows the attribute binding to be dynamic in the case that they are dynamic the reference to the dynamic value are reflected into the ivy instruction for attribute binding pr close 	fix
6837	ivy support tracking the provenance of dynamicvalue dynamicvalues are generated whenever a partially evaluated expression is unable to be resolved statically they contain a reference to the tsnode which wasnt resolvable they can also be nested for example the expression a b is resolvable only if a and b are themselves resolvable if either a or b resolve to a dynamicvalue the whole expression must also resolve to a dynamicvalue previously if a resolved to a dynamicvalue the entire expression might have been resolved to the same dynamicvalue this correctly indicated that the expression wasnt resolvable but didnt return a reference to the shallow node that couldnt be resolved the expression a b only a reference to the deep node that couldnt be resolved a in certain situation it very useful to know the shallow unresolvable node for example to use it verbatim in the output to support this the partial evaluator is updated to always wrap dynamicvalue to point to each unresolvable expression a it processed ensuring the receiver can determine exactly which expression node failed to resolve pr close 	feat

7311	ivy reference external class by their exported name previously ngtsc would assume that a given directivepipe being imported from an external package wa importable using the same name by which it wa declared this isnt always true sometimes a package will export a directive under a different name for example angular frequently prefix directive name with the ɵ character to indicate that theyre part of the package private api and not for public consumption this commit introduces the tsreferenceresolver class which given a declaration to import and a module name to import it from can determine the exported name of the declared class within the module this allows ngtsc to pick the correct name by which to import the class instead of making assumption about how it wa exported this resolver is used to select a correct symbol name when creating an absolutereference fw resolve fw resolve pr close 	feat

7617	core export a value for injectflags a recent commit probably cc ha changed the import graph of the di type in core and somehow result in the ngc compiler deciding to reexport core di type from application factory which tangentially use inject this is not really surprising ngcs import graph can be very unstable however this result in a reexport of injectflags surviving j compilation injectflags wa a const enum akin to an interface in t with no runtime repesentation this cause a warning to be emitted by webpack when it see the reexport of injectflags this commit avoids the issue by removing const from the declaration of injectflags causing it to have a runtime value this is a temporary fix the real fix will be for ngc to no longer write export of const enums testing strategy manually verified due to the problem only manifesting when recompiling after a change and then running webpack there is no existing framework via which this could be easily tested with an integration test additionally the potential for this issue is gone in ivy so this solution is only temporarily needed fix pr close 	fix

7765	ivy use wrapped metadata in all decoratorhandlers previously the directive injectable and pipe decoratorhandlers were directly returning angularcompiler metadata from their analyze step this precludes returning any additional information along with that metadata this commit introduces a wrapper interface for these handler opening the door for additional information to be returned from analyze testing strategy this is a refactor commit existing test coverage is sufficient pr close 	refactor
7766	ivy capture the identifier of a decorator during reflection previously the reflectionhost api only returned the name of decorator and not a reference to their typescript identifier this commit add the identifier itself so that a consumer can write reference to the decorator testing strategy this commit is trivial and the functionality will be exercised by downstream test pr close 	feat

7853	ivy obviate the bazel component of the ivyswitch originally the ivyswitch mechanism used bazel genrules to conditionally compile one t file or another depending on whether ngc or ngtsc wa the selected compiler this wa done because we wanted to avoid importing certain module and thus pulling them into the build if ivy wa on or off this mechanism had a major drawback ivyswitch became a bottleneck in the import graph a it both import from many place in the codebase and is imported by many module in the codebase this frequently resulted in cyclic import which caused issue both with t and closure compilation it turn out ngcc need both code path in the bundle to perform the switch during it operation anyway so import switching wa later abandoned this mean that there no real reason why the ivyswitch mechanism needed to operate at the bazel level and for the ivyswitch file to be a bottleneck this commit remove the bazellevel ivyswitch mechanism and introduces an additional typescript transform in ngtsc and the passthrough tsc compiler used for testing jit to perform the same operation that ngcc doe and flip the switch during ngtsc compilation this allows the ivyswitch file to be removed and the individual switch to be located directly next to their consumer in the codebase greatly mitigating the circular import issue and making the mechanism much easier to use a part of this commit the tag for marking switched variable wa changed from prengcc to prer since it no longer just ngcc which flip these tag most variable were renamed from r to switch a well since theyre referenced mostly in render code test strategy existing test coverage is more than sufficient if this didnt work correctly it would break the hello world and todo apps pr close 	refactor

8450	ivy selector side of modulewithproviders via type metadata within an ngmodule it common to include in the import a call to a modulewithproviders function for example routermoduleforroot the old ngc compiler wa able to handle this pattern because it had global knowledge of metadata of not only the input compilation unit but also all dependency the ngtsc compiler for ivy doesnt have this knowledge so the pattern of modulewithproviders function is more difficult ngtsc must be able to determine which module is imported via the function in order to expand the selector scope and properly treeshake directive and pipe this commit implement a solution to this problem by adding a type parameter to modulewithproviders through which the actual module type can be passed between compilation unit the provider side isnt a problem because the import are always copied directly to the nginjectordef pr close 	feat

9881	aio simplify gaservice to avoid ee test failure the gaservice and the ee spec were unnecessarily complicated and had arbitrary async timeouts to ensure that the interplay between the ga library code and the rest of the app worked correctly this resulted in potential flaky test if the timeouts were not adequate this wa experienced when travis upgraded to chrome the new approach is to block loading of the analytics library altogether if there is a ee flag set in the sessionstorage of the browser it doesnt appear to be enough just to set the flag directly on the window i think this is because the window get cleaned when navigation occurs but i am not certain the downside of this is that we had to add a small piece of extra logic to the ga snippet in indexhtml and we also had to switch from using script async to a programmatic approach to loading the ga library which prevents the browser from eagerly fetching the library this may be mitigated by adding it to the http push configuration of the firebase hosting reenables the test that wa disabled in close 	fix

10176	common drop use of the intl api to improve browser support breaking change because of multiple bug and browser inconsistency we have dropped the intl api in favor of data exported from the unicode common locale data repository cldr unfortunately we had to change the in pipe date number currency percent and there are some breaking change in pipe breaking change by default angular now only contains locale data for the language enus if you set the value of localeid to another locale you will have to import new locale data for this language because we dont use the intl api anymore feature you dont need to use the intl polyfill for angular anymore all in pipe now have an additional last parameter locale which allows you to use a specific locale instead of the one defined in the token localeid whose value is enus by default the new locale data extracted from cldr are now available to developer a well and can be used through an api which should be especially useful for library author you can still use the old pipe for now but their name have been changed and they are no longer included in the commonmodule to use them you will have to import the deprecatedinpipesmodule after the commonmodule the order is important t import ngmodule from angularcore import commonmodule deprecatedinpipesmodule from angularcommon ngmodule import commonmodule import deprecated module after deprecatedinpipesmodule export class appmodule dont forget that you will still need to import the intl api polyfill if you want to use those deprecated pipe date pipe breaking change the predefined format short shorttime shortdate medium now use the pattern given by cldr like it wa in angularjs instead of the one from the intl api you might notice some change eg shortdate will be instead of for enus the narrow version of era is now ggggg instead of g the format g is now similar to gg and ggg the narrow version of month is now mmmmm instead of l the format l is now the short standalone version of month the narrow version of the week day is now eeeee instead of e the format e is now similar to ee and eee the timezone z will now fallback to o and output gmt instead of the complete zone name eg pacific standard time this is because the quantity of data required to have all the zone name in all of the existing locale is too big the timezone z will now output the iso basic format eg you should now use zzzz to get gmt field type format example value v v era narrow a for ad g ggggg month narrow s for september l mmmmm week day narrow m for monday e eeeee timezone long location pacific standard time z not available timezone long gmt gmt z zzzz feature new predefined format long full longtime fulltime the format yyy is now supported eg the year will be and the year will be standalone month are now supported with the format l to lllll week of the year is now supported with the format w and ww eg week and week of the month is now supported with the format w eg week fractional second are now supported with the format s to ss day period for ampm now support additional format aa aaa aaaa and aaaaa the format a to aaa are similar while aaaa is the wide version if available eg ante meridiem for am or equivalent to a otherwise and aaaaa is the narrow version eg a for am extra day period are now supported with the format b to bbbbb and b to bbbbb for the standalone equivalent eg morning noon afternoon the short nonlocalized timezones are now available with the format o to oooo the format o to ooo will output gmt while the format oooo will be gmt the iso basic time zone are now available with the format z to zzzzz the format z to zzz will output while the format zzzz will be gmt and zzzzz will be bug fix the date pipe will now work exactly the same across all browser which will fix a lot of bug for safari and ie era can now be used on their own without the date eg the format gg will be ad instead of ad currency pipe breaking change the default value for symboldisplay is now symbol instead of code this mean that by default you will see for enus instead of usd previously deprecation the second parameter of the currency pipe symboldisplay is no longer a boolean it now take the value code symbol or symbolnarrow a boolean value is still valid for now but it is deprecated and it will print a warning message in the console feature you can now choose between code symbol or symbolnarrow which give you access to more option for some currency eg the canadian dollar with the code cad ha the symbol ca and the symbolnarrow percent pipe breaking change if you dont specify the number of digit to round to the local format will be used and it usually round number to digit instead of not rounding previously eg percent will output for the locale enus instead of previously fix pr close 	feat

10462	aio activate serviceworker update asap previouly whenever a new serviceworker update wa detected the user wa prompted to update with a notification this turned out to be more distracting than helpful also one would get notification on all open browser tabswindows and had to manually reload each one in order for the whole content including the app to be updated this commit change the update strategy a follows whenever a new update is detected it is immediately activated and all tabswindows will be notified once an update is activated regardless of whether the activation wa initiated by the current tabwindow or not a flag will be set to do a full page navigation the next time the user navigates to a document benefit all tabswindows are updated asap the update are applied authomatically without the user needing to do anything the update are applied in a way that a ensures that the app and content version are always compatible b doe not distract the user from their usual workflow note the full page navigation may cause a flash while the page is loading from scratch but this is expected to be minimal since at that point almost all necessary resource are cached by and served from the serviceworker fix 	fix
